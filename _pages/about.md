I am Sipeng Yang, a Ph.D. candidate at the State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, under the guidance of Professor [Jin](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin/). I received my BSc degree from Southeast University, China, in 2018.

My research focuses on developing **lightweight supersampling algorithms** for real-time rendering on mobile devices, aiming to achieve high-quality rendering results with low sampling rates. This work is highly beneficial for gaming on smartphones.

I am also interested in **geometry processing**, specifically in the generation, refinement, and feature extraction/conversion of 3D mesh models.

For collaboration or inquiries, feel free to contact me at 12121024@zju.edu.cn.
